This application was apart of WGU's C964 course. 

This application takes a cleaned dataset of cancer patient data in order to make predictions on if a patient has cancer based on their submitted information. Data visualizations will be shown upon running the program, and they are further explained in detail in the included Word doc.

For more information on this application and how data is handled, see parts B and D in the Word doc.
